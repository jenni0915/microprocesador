Topics Covered:
Hardware interrupts and timer usage
Event-driven programming without polling
Debouncing physical push buttons
Analog input/output using ADC and PWM

Key Tasks:
Replace polling with IRQ-based logic using mbed's low-level timer APIs.
Implement debouncing techniques via:
Sampling delay method
Edge-detection with timing
LDR-based control of LEDs and display brightness using PWM
