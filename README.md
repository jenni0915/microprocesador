This repository contains the code and documentation for three practical labs carried out as part of the Microprocessors course at UPM. 
Each practice progressively explores core embedded systems concepts using an STM microcontroller and the mbed development environment.

Language: C / C++ (embedded)
Platform: STM32 microcontroller with mbed OS
Tools: ÂµVision 5, Tera Term for serial output
