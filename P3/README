Topics Covered:
Finite State Machines (FSM)
Cooperative FSM for multitasking
Ultrasonic sensor interfacing (HC-SR04)
Complex embedded control structure

Key Tasks:
Measure distance using the HC-SR04 sensor via ECHO/TRIG signals.
Implement two versions of distance reading logic:
  Independent event management
  FSM-based design
Construct an FSM for:
  Button debouncing
  Display multiplexing
  System-level orchestration
